      <h2>Using machine learning to identify diseases</h2>
      <p>At Picture Pathology, we are dedicated to using the principles of computer science and machine learning for the benefit of all mankind. By accessing a wide range of pictures from around the world, we maintain a data set that allows for quicker recognition of common skin diseases. This reduces the needs of people to see specialists, cutting down on healthcare costs, wait times, and providing better care for those who need it.</p>

      <h2>Privacy is #1</h2>
      <p>We will never ask for your name or personal information. Nor do we store any photographs that we are sent. We collect photography data and analyse it against other photos of know conditions. If allowed, you can give us permission to access your location data and/or other important information. This is to help us better understand the underlying factors that may be causing certain issues.</p>
